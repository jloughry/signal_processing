\section{Introduction}

Printers are one of the basic elements of a computer system. They translate
the electronic form of processed data into graphical form during the printing
process. As with every electronic device, printers are sources of
electromagnetic emanations. Besides control signals, which carry no
information ({\it e.g.}, directing the operation of stepper motors or
heaters), there are other signals (useful signals) that are correlated with
the information being processed. Such emissions are called `sensitive' or
`valuable' or `compromising' emanations from the point of view of
electromagnetic protection of processed information. Processed data may
be information displayed on a computer screen or printed (Figure
\ref{figure:Figure_01}).

\begin{figure}[!t]

\end{figure}

Like other devices included in a computer system \cite{Kuhn2002,Kubiak2016a},
the printer can be subject to electromagnetic infiltration, or eavesdropping
\cite{Ketenci2015a,Kubiak2016b}. Therefore, efforts to reduce the level of
susceptibility to electromagnetic eavesdropping initiated for such devices.
Organisational and technical solutions \cite{Kubiak2006a} are the most
often-used methods for limiting infiltration
sensitivity of devices.\footnote{An example of an organisational solution
might be establishment of a `control zone' around susceptible devices,
relying on distance to attenuate signals below levels that can be received
outside the control zone.} Technical solutions are limited to changes in the
design of devices that typically increase the cost of such devices and
sometimes limit their functionality. Therefore, it is desirable to find
solutions that avoid these drawbacks and at the same time allow `safe'
processing of classified information \cite{Wasfy2011a,Goel2012a}.

One technical method that is commonly used in the field of electromagnetic
compatibility---both to reduce the amount of electromagnetic interference
emitted from the device and the susceptibility of the device to
electromagnetic disturbance---is the use of differential signals. Analysis
of useful signals and control signals \cite{Kubiak2017d} in the operation of
LED arrays
used in printers shows that such a design was used by the $B$ printer in the
operation of its photoconductor exposure system. Is this sufficient, however,
to foil non-invasive information gathering? Research and results are
presented in this article.

    \label{figure:Figure_02b}}
    \caption{Two printers, $A$ and $B$, were tested for sensitive emissions.}
    \label{figure:Figure_02}
\end{figure*}

The clear answer is that the solution adopted in the design of the $B$
printer (Figure \ref{figure:Figure_02b}) significantly reduces the
susceptibility of the device to infiltration, in comparison to the $A$
printer (Figure \ref{figure:Figure_02a}). Moreover, the level of
electromagnetic [emission?] of the $A$ printer is higher than that of
typical single and dual diode laser printers \cite{Kubiak2014b}.
